# Python Streeter Phelps Model
This repository houses an example application of the Jupyter Notebook to build an interactive version of the Streeter-Phelps Model, which is often used to model dissolved oxygen dynamics in rivers. The goal is to illustrate how Python can be used to quickly build a useful application through the Anaconda environment. The code needed to create the model is only 20 lines.

An interactive version of the notebook can be viewed here:
